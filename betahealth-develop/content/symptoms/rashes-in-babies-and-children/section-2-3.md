A raised, red, itchy rash (hives) can appear as an allergic reaction to things
like stings, medicines or food.

It usually clears up within a day or two.

Speak to your GP if your child keeps getting this type of rash. They may be
allergic to something.

Call 999 if there's swelling around the mouth.
