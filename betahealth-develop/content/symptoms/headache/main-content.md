## Treating headaches at home

You can simply wait until the headache goes away or take painkillers like
paracetamol or ibuprofen. You can buy these over the counter.

This will also help with headaches:

* drink plenty of water
* eat regular meals
* sleep the same amount of hours every night

Headaches can last between 30 minutes and several hours.

## What causes headaches

You can get headaches because of something else, for example cold, flu,
bad posture or stress.

Some women get headaches when they’re on the pill or during their
period or menopause.
