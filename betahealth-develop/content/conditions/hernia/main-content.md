## Your hernia treatment

Your GP will confirm if your lump is a hernia and discuss how it can be treated.

You’ll need an [operation](/conditions/hernia/operation) to repair your hernia.
You may not need one straight away - it depends on the the type of hernia and
if it’s causing you problems. Your hernia may get bigger if it’s not treated,
although this could take months or even years.

### Hernia surgery

You should be able to have a hernia operation within 18 weeks of your GP
appointment.

You’ll need to have some appointments before you have your hernia operation.
