## Types of hernia

Different types of hernia develop in different parts of the body.

### Hernias in the groin

An inguinal hernia shows in the upper thigh, groin or as a swelling around the
scrotum. The bowel pushes into an area called the inguinal canal. It’s the most
common type of hernia and mostly affects men.

A femoral hernia also show in the upper thigh or groin. The bowel pushes into
an area called the femoral canal. Around 1 in 20 hernias are femoral. They
mostly affect women.

### Hernias in the tummy area

An [umbilical hernia](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/UmbilicalHernia/Pages/Whatisitpage.aspx)
shows as a lump near the belly button. It’s common in babies but can
affect adults.

An epigastric hernia usually appears between your belly button and your
breastbone.

A spigelian hernia usually appears on the side of your tummy area (below the
belly button).

### Hernias in the chest

A [hiatus hernia](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Hernia-hiatus/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
happens when part of the stomach pushes into your chest. It may not cause a
lump, but it can cause heartburn and a funny taste in your mouth.

## Hernia complications

Hernias can sometimes cause problems, which should be treated immediately.

If the bowel gets stuck in the hernia, it can become blocked (obstruction).

If the gap in the muscle becomes too tight, it can trap the bowel and cut off
its blood supply (strangulation).
