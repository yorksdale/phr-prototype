During your pre-operative assessment the nurse will ask you about your health
and do things like:

* take your blood pressure
* weigh you
* test you for bacteria, such as [MRSA](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/MRSA/Pages/Introduction.aspx)

You may need other tests, like blood tests and you may also speak to the
anaesthetist.

If you take medicine, bring it with you (including vitamins and herbal
supplements).

Youâ€™ll also be give more information about your surgery, such as the time and
what you can and drink on the day.

This appointment usually lasts an hour.
