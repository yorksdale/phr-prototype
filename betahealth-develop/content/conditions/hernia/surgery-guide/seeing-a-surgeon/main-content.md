The surgeon will talk you through the treatments that could help you, and you
can decide the best treatment together. You might decide it’s not surgery.

## Questions you might want to ask

* What are the different types of treatment, including non-surgical options?
* What will happen if I don’t have surgery?
* What are the benefits, side effects and risks of these treatments?
* What type of anaesthetic will I need?
* What’s the difference between keyhole and open surgery?

## Other practical questions you may want to ask

* How long is the waiting list for this operation?
* How long will I stay in hospital?
* How long will I need to take off work?
* Will I have a scar?
* How long will it take me to recover and get back to normal?

You can ask any question you want. This is your time with the surgeon.
