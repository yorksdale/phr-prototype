## Your pharmacist can help with mouth ulcers

Your pharmacist can recommend a treatment to speed up healing, prevent infection or reduce pain, for example:

- antimicrobial mouthwash 
- a painkilling mouthwash, gel or spray
- corticosteroid lozenges

You can buy these without a prescription but they may not always work.

  ## See a dentist or GP if your mouth ulcer:
  
  - lasts longer than 3 weeks
  - keeps coming back
  - becomes more painful and red - this may be a sign of an infection

  Although most mouth ulcers are harmless, a long-lasting mouth ulcer is sometimes a sign of mouth cancer. Itâ€™s best to get it checked.
