Mouth ulcers usually appear inside the mouth on the cheeks, tongue or lips. You may have more than one ulcer at
a time and they can change in size.

Mouth ulcers aren’t contagious and they shouldn't be confused with cold sores. Cold sores appear on the lips
or around the mouth and often begin with a tingling, itching or burning sensation.

If you have several mouth ulcers, this can be a symptom of:

- [hand, foot and mouth disease](/conditions/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease) - which also causes a rash on the hands and feet
- oral [lichen planus](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Lichen-planus/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - which causes a white,
  lacy pattern inside the cheeks

## You can’t always prevent mouth ulcers

Most single mouth ulcers are caused by things you can try to avoid, such as:

- biting the inside of your cheek
- badly-fitting dentures, braces, rough fillings or a sharp tooth
- cuts or burns while eating or drinking - for example, hard food or hot drinks
- a food intolerance or allergy
- damaging your gums with a toothbrush or irritating toothpaste
- feeling tired, stressed or anxious

Sometime they’re triggered by things you can’t always control, for example:

- hormonal changes - such as during pregnancy
- your genes - some families get mouth ulcers more often
- a long-term condition - such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), coeliac disease or Behçet's disease
- a vitamin B12 or iron deficiency
- medications - including some NSAIDs, beta-blockers or nicorandil
- stopping smoking - people may develop mouth ulcers when they first stop smoking
