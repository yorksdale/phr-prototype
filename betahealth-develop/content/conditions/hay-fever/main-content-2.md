### Treatments for hay fever from your GP

Your GP might prescribe steroids.

If steroids and other hayfever treatments don’t work your GP may refer you for
immunotherapy. This means you’ll be given small amounts of pollen as an injection
or tablet to slowly build up your immunity to pollen.

This kind of treatment usually starts in the winter about 3 months before the
hay fever season begins.

## What causes hay fever

Hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen typically when it comes into contact
with your mouth, nose, eyes and throat. Pollen is a fine powder from plants.
