## You can’t always prevent diarrhoea

However, good [food hygiene](https://www.food.gov.uk/) can reduce the risk of getting it.

While you have diarrhoea:
- wash your hands well every time you’ve been to the toilet
- clean the toilet after you’ve gone
- don’t share towels and things you put in your mouth like cutlery
- wash soiled clothes or bed linen at 60 degrees or higher

As part of their [routine childhood vaccination](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/rotavirus-vaccine.aspx)
children are vaccinated against rotavirus, which causes diarrhoea.
