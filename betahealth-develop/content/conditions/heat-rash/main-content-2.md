## Your pharmacist can help with heat rash

To help soothe sore and itchy skin you can:

- use calamine lotion
- use hydrocortisone cream (but not on the face)
- take antihistamine tablets (but speak to a pharmacist first as they’re not
  always appropriate)

You can buy these from a pharmacy. The pharmacist can advise you on the best
medicines to use, for example if you’re pregnant or a child has the rash.

## Causes of heat rash

Heat rash is usually caused by excessive sweating.

Sweat glands get blocked and the trapped sweat causes a rash to develop a few
days later.

Babies often get it because they can’t control their temperature as well as
adults and children.

Sweating is usually caused by hot or humid weather but other things can cause
it. For example, being overweight or spending long periods in bed, perhaps
because of an illness.
