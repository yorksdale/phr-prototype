## Check if it is constipation

It’s likely to be constipation if:

- you or your child haven’t had a poo at least three times in a week
- the poo is often difficult to push out and larger than usual
- the poo is often dry, hard or lumpy

However, it’s not unusual for a breastfeeding baby to go a week without having a poo.

You may also have a [stomach ache](/symptoms/stomach-ache)
and feel bloated or sick.

Things to look out for in babies and toddlers includes:

- a lack of energy
- being irritable, angry or unhappy
- [soiling their clothes](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/encopresis/Pages/Introduction.aspx)

## What causes constipation

Constipation in adults has many possible causes. Sometimes there is no obvious reason.

The most common causes include:

- not eating enough fibre - such as fruit, vegetables and cereals
- not drinking enough fluids
- not exercising or being less active
- often ignoring the urge to go to the toilet
- changing your diet or daily routine
- stress, anxiety or depression
- a side effect of medication

Constipation is also common during pregnancy and for six weeks after giving birth.

In much rarer cases, constipation may be caused by a medical condition.

raise your knees above your hips.

## Babies and toddlers: what causes constipation

Constipation in babies and toddlers has many possible causes. Sometimes there is no obvious reason.

It usually happens when your child:

- first starts taking formula or processed foods as a baby
- is being potty trained as a toddler
- has just started school

The most common causes include:

- not eating enough fibre - such as fruit, vegetables and cereals
- not drinking enough fluids
- over-feeding - including giving babies too much milk
- fear or anxiety about using the toilet - at home or at school
- poor potty training - such as feeling pressured or being regularly interrupted

In much rarer cases, constipation in babies and toddlers may be caused by a medical condition.

## Babies and toddlers: treating constipation

Simple changes to your child’s diet and potty training can help treat constipation.

You may notice a difference within a few days. Sometimes it takes a few weeks before their symptoms improve.

### Make changes to your child’s diet

Give your baby extra water between their normal feeds if they haven’t started to eat solid food yet. If you’re using
formula milk, don’t add more water to the mixture.

Try gently moving your baby's legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help
stimulate their bowels.

Give older children plenty of fluids and encourage them to eat fruit. Chop or puree it if it’s easier for them to eat.
The best fruits for constipation include apples, grapes, pears and strawberries.

Don’t force your child to eat as this can make mealtimes stressful.

### Helping your child with potty training

Some children feel anxious or stressed about using the toilet. This can cause them to hold in their poo and
lead to constipation.

This usually happens during potty training or if their usual toilet routine has changed.
For example, after moving house or starting nursery.

Give your child plenty of time to use the toilet while they are still learning. Encourage them when they
do use the toilet. Some parents find a reward chart works.

## Your pharmacist can help with constipation

Speak to your pharmacist if diet and lifestyle changes aren’t helping. They can suggest a suitable laxative.
These are medicines that help you poo more regularly.

Most laxatives work within 3 days. They should only be used for a short time.

Laxatives are not recommended for children unless they are prescribed by your GP.
