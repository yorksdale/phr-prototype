## How to treat a sore throat yourself

To help soothe a sore throat and shorten how long it lasts you can:

- gargle with warm salty water
- drink plenty of water - but avoid hot drinks
- eat cool or soft foods
- avoid smoking or smoky places
- suck ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets - but don't give young children anything
  small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking
- rest

::: reveal How to gargle with salt water
  1. Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water - warm water helps salt dissolve.
  2. Gargle with the solution then spit it out - don’t swallow it.
  3. Repeat as often as you like.

## Your pharmacist can help with sore throats

To help relieve the pain and discomfort of a sore throat you can:

- use paracetamol or ibuprofen
- use medicated lozenges or anaesthetic sprays (although there’s little proof they help)

You can buy them from a supermarket or from a pharmacist without a prescription.

- dry scratchy throat
- redness in the back of the mouth

The symptoms are similar for children, but children can also get a temperature and appear less active.
