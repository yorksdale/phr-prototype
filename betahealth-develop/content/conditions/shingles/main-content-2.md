## Stay away from certain groups of people if you have shingles

Try to avoid:

* pregnant women who have not had chickenpox before
* people with a weakened immune system, such as someone with HIV or AIDS
* babies less than one month old (unless it is your own baby, as they
  should be protected from the virus by your immune system)

## Stay off work or school until the rash scabs

Shingles is contagious only while the rash oozes fluid.

## Shingles and pregnancy

If you’re pregnant and get shingles, there is no danger to your pregnancy or baby.

If your GP thinks you need medicine, they may speak to a specialist to decide whether the benefits of medication
outweigh any possible risk.

## You can’t get shingles from chickenpox

You can’t get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.

However, you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles, if you haven’t had chickenpox before.

When people get chickenpox, the virus remains in the body. It can be reactivated later and cause shingles if someone’s
immune system is lowered. This can be because of stress, certain conditions or treatments like chemotherapy.
