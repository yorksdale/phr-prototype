## Treatment from your GP

Your GP might burst a large or painful blister using a sterilised needle. If your blister is infected, they may prescribe antibiotics.

They can also offer treatment and advice if blisters are caused by a medical condition.

## How to prevent blisters

Blisters develop to protect damaged skin and help it heal. They are mostly caused by friction, burns and skin reactions,
such as an allergic reaction. 

Blood blisters appear when blood vessels in the skin have also been damaged. They are often more painful than a regular blister.

If you regularly get friction blisters, some simple changes may help:

- wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes
- gradually break in new shoes
- wear thicker wool socks during exercise
- dust talcum powder in your socks if you get sweaty feet
- wear protective gloves when you exercise or if you use tools at work
