## How you can treat or prevent piles yourself  

Piles often go away on their own after a few days.  

To relieve any pain or discomfort when you go to the toilet:

- avoid straining when you’re on the toilet
- use moist toilet paper or baby wipes
- dab the area clean, rather than wiping it

To keep your poo soft, help you go to the toilet regularly and stop your piles getting bigger:

- drink plenty of fluid 
- [eat more fibre](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/how-to-get-more-fibre-into-your-diet.aspx)
  (fruit and vegetables, wholegrain bread, pasta and cereal)
- try to avoid drinking too much caffeine (in drinks like tea, coffee and cola)

## Your pharmacist can help with piles

To relieve swelling, itching and pain you can buy:

- creams and ointments
- suppositories (which are inserted into your bottom)

Pharmacists can give you advice about which product is best for you. Ask your pharmacist if you can speak to them
in a private area if you’re embarrassed. 

You shouldn’t use piles medicines for longer than a week as they can irritate your skin. Don’t use more than
one product at the same time.
