## How you can treat earwax build-up yourself

!!! warning
  Don’t use your fingers or any objects like cotton buds to remove the earwax. This will push it further in and make it worse.
!!!

Usually earwax falls out on its own. If it doesn’t and blocks your ear, put 2 to 3 drops of olive or almond oil in your ear twice a day for a few days. Over a week or 2 weeks large lumps of earwax can fall out of your ear, especially at night when you’re lying down.

There is no proof that ear candles or ear vacuums get rid of earwax.

## Your pharmacist can help with earwax build-up

To dissolve the earwax you can buy chemical drops from a pharmacy.

The earwax should fall out on its own or dissolve after about a week.

Don’t use drops if you have a hole in your eardrum. Ask your pharmacist what you can do instead.

!!! attention
  ## See a nurse in your GP practice if:

  - your ear hasn’t cleared after 5 days
  - your ear is badly blocked and you can’t hear anything (you can get an infection if it isn’t cleared)
!!!


### How the nurse can remove earwax

They can:

- flush the wax out with water (ear irrigation)
- suck the wax out (microsuction)

These treatments are usually painless.


## Preventing earwax

You can’t prevent earwax. It’s there to protect your ears from dirt and germs.

However, you can keep using ear drops to soften the wax. This will help it fall out on its own and should prevent blocked ears.


## Causes of earwax

You might have earwax build-up because:

- you just have more wax in your ears (some people naturally do)
- you have hairy or narrow canals (the tubes that link the eardrum and outer ear)
- of your age - wax gets harder and more difficult to fall out
- of hearing aids, earplugs and other things you put in your ear - these can push the wax further in


## How to tell if your ear is blocked with earwax

You can have:

- earache
- difficulty hearing
- itchiness
- dizziness
- an ear infection
- sounds such as high-pitched tones coming from inside the ear (tinnitus)

Once the earwax is removed these symptoms usually improve. If they don’t, see the nurse in your GP practice.
