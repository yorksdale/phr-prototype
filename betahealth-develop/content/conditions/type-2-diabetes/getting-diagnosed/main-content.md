## Getting diagnosed

Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed following blood or urine tests for
something else.

However, if you have any [symptoms of diabetes](check-if-you-have-it) you
should see your GP straight away.

To find out if you have type 2 diabetes, you usually have to go through the
following steps:

1. Speak to your GP about your symptoms.
2. Your GP will check your urine and arrange a blood test to check your blood
   sugar levels. It usually takes about 1 to 2 days for the results to come back.
3. If you have diabetes, your GP will ask you to come in again to explain the
   test results and what will happen next.

### If you’re diagnosed with diabetes

What your GP will discuss with you during your appointment depends on the
diagnosis and the treatment they recommend.

Generally, they’ll talk to you about:

* what diabetes is
* what high blood sugar means for your health
* what medication you’ll have to take
* your diet and exercise
* your lifestyle, for example alcohol and smoking

!!! warning
Your GP will do their best to discuss the diagnosis with you but this first
appointment might only be 10 to 15 minutes.

### If you have questions about your diagnosis

It’s usually difficult to take in everything the GP tells you during the
appointment.

Talk to family and friends about what the GP told you and write down all the
questions you have.

Then make another GP appointment and take your list of questions with you.

There’s also a lot of [information on diabetes](finding-help-and-support)
available.

Usually the following things happen after your diagnosis:

1. Your GP will prescribe [medication](understanding-medication). It might take
   time for you to get used to the medication and to find the right amounts for you.
