## Check if you have flu

Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include:

- a sudden fever - a temperature of 38C or above
- aching body
- feeling tired or exhausted
- dry, chesty cough
- sore throat
- headache
- difficulty sleeping
- loss of appetite
- diarrhoea or tummy pain
- nausea and being sick

The symptoms are similar for children but they can also get pain in their ear and appear less active.

  [Cold](/conditions/cold#check-if-you-have-a-cold) and flu symptoms are similar but flu tends to be more severe.

  | Flu | Cold |
  |-----|------|
  | Appears quickly within a few hours  | Appears gradually |
  | Affects more than just your nose and throat |  Affects mainly your nose and throat |
  | Makes you feel exhausted and too unwell to carry on as normal |  Makes you feel unwell but you’re okay to carry on as normal – for example, go to work |

## How to treat flu yourself

To help you get better more quickly:

- rest and sleep
- keep warm
- take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains
- drink plenty of water to [avoid dehydration](/conditions/dehydration#how-to-prevent-dehydration)
  (your pee should be light yellow or clear)

## Your pharmacist can help with flu

Your pharmacist can give treatment advice and recommend flu remedies.

Be careful not to use them if you’re taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets as it’s easy to take more than the recommended dose.

Speak to your pharmacist before giving medicines to children.

## How to avoid spreading the flu

Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You’re more likely to give it to others in the first 5 days.

Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.

To reduce the risk of spreading flu:

- wash your hands often with warm water and soap
- use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
- bin used tissues as quickly as possible

### How to prevent flu

The flu vaccine reduces the risk of catching flu as well as spreading it to others.

It’s more effective to get the vaccine before the start of the flu season (December to March).
