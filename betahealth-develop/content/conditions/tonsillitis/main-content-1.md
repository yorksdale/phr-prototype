## Check if you have tonsillitis

Tonsillitis can feel like a bad cold or flu. The tonsils at the back of your
throat will be red and swollen.

The main symptoms in children and adults are:

- a sore throat
- difficulty swallowing
- hoarse or no voice
- a high temperature of 38C or above
- coughing
- headache
- feeling sick
- earache
- feeling tired

Sometimes the symptoms can be more severe, such as:

- swollen painful glands in your neck - feels like a lump on the side of your neck
- white pus-filled spots on your tonsils at the back of your throat
- bad breath
