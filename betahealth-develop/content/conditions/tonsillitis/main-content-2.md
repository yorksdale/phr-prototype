If you’re not sure it’s tonsillitis [check other sore throat symptoms](/conditions/sore-throat).

## How long tonsillitis lasts

Symptoms will usually go away after 3 to 4 days.

Tonsillitis isn’t contagious but the infections that cause it are (for example,
colds and flu).

To stop these infections from spreading:

- stay off work or keep your child at home until you or your child feel better
- use tissues when you cough or sneeze and throw them away after
- wash your hands after coughing or sneezing

## How to treat tonsillitis yourself

Tonsillitis usually has to run its course. To help ease the symptoms:

- get plenty of rest
- drink cool drinks to soothe the throat
- take paracetamol or ibuprofen (don’t give aspirin to children under 16)
- gargle with warm salty water

::: reveal How to gargle with salty water
  1. Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water - warm water
     helps salt dissolve.
  1. Gargle with the solution then spit it out - don’t swallow it.
  1. Repeat as often as you like.

  This isn’t suitable for younger children.

## See a GP if:

- the sore throat is so painful it’s difficult to eat or drink
- the symptoms don’t go away after 4 days

## What happens at your appointment

Your doctor can usually tell its tonsillitis by asking about your symptoms and
looking at the back of your throat. Sometimes they might:

- wipe a cotton bud at the back of your throat to test for bacteria
- organise a blood test to rule out [glandular fever](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Glandular-fever/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (if your symptoms are severe or won’t go away)

Usually you’ll get any test results back within a couple of days.

## Treatment from a GP

Treatment will depend on what caused your tonsillitis:

- a virus (viral tonsillitis), which most children and adults have - this type
  has to run its course and antibiotics won’t help
- bacteria (bacterial tonsillitis) - your GP may prescribe antibiotics

Usually your GP will have to wait for the test results to tell which type you have.

!!! warning
It’s very rare that someone needs to have their tonsils taken out. This is
usually only the case if you have severe tonsillitis that keeps coming back.

## Complications with tonsillitis (quinsy)

teenagers and young adults.

Sometimes you can get a pocket filled with pus (abscess) between your tonsils
and the wall of your throat. This is called quinsy.
