## Your pharmacist can help with hives

Your pharmacist can give you advice about the best treatment to bring down your
hives rash.

To relieve any pain or itchiness you can use:

- a steroid cream
- a cooling cream such as calamine

To bring down the rash, you can take [antihistamine tablets](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Antihistamines/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

Tell your pharmacist if you have a long-term condition because you might not be
able to take antihistamines. They may also not be suitable for young children.
