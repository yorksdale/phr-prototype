Head lice sometimes can make your head feel:

* itchy
* like something is moving in your hair

The only way to be sure someone has head lice is by finding live lice or
eggs. You can do this by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed
comb (detection comb). You can buy these online or at pharmacies.

## How to get rid of head lice

!!! warning
You can treat head lice without seeing your GP.
!!!

Treat head lice as soon as you spot them. You should check everyone in the
house, and treat them on the same day if they have head lice.

There’s no need to keep your child off school with head lice.

### Use lotion or spray to treat head lice

You can use medicated lotions and sprays that kill head lice in all types
of hair, including afro hair. You can buy these from pharmacies,
supermarkets or online.

Head lice should die within a day. Lotions and sprays come with a comb to
remove dead lice and eggs.

Some treatments need to be repeated after a week to kill any newly-hatched
lice. Check the pack to see whether they’re okay for you or your child to
use and how long they should be left in the hair.

If lotions or sprays don’t work, speak to your pharmacist about other
treatments.

Some treatments aren’t recommended because they’re unlikely to work:

* products containing permethrin
* head lice “repellents”
* electric head lice combs
* tree and plant oil treatments, such as tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil,
  and lavender oil herbal remedies

### If you don’t want to use chemicals

You can buy a special fine-toothed comb (detection comb) online or from
pharmacies to remove head lice and nits.

Follow the instructions on the pack, but generally you:

* use the comb on wet or dry hair, although it usually works best on wet
  hair with conditioner
* comb the whole head of hair, from the roots to the end of the hair
* repeat every few days for 2 weeks

## You can’t prevent head lice

There’s nothing you can do to prevent head lice. You can reduce the risk
of lice spreading by avoiding head-to-head contact.

Don’t use medicated lotions and sprays to prevent head lice. This can
irritate the scalp.

There’s no need for children to stay off school, or to wash laundry on a
hot wash.
