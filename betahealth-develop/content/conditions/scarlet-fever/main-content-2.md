The symptoms are the same for children and adults, although scarlet fever is
much rarer in adults.

!!! attention
## See a GP if you or your child:
- has scarlet fever symptoms
- doesn’t get better in a week (after seeing the GP), especially if your child
  has recently had chickenpox
- is ill again weeks after scarlet fever has cleared up - this can be a sign
  of a complication, such as pneumonia
!!!

## What happens at your appointment

GPs can often diagnose scarlet fever by looking at the tongue and rash.
Sometimes they may:

- wipe a cotton bud around the back of the throat to test for bacteria
- arrange a blood test

## Treating scarlet fever

Your GP will prescribe antibiotics. They don’t cure scarlet fever, but will
help you get better quicker. They also reduce the risk of serious illnesses,
such as pneumonia.

It’s important to keep taking antibiotics until they’re finished, even when you
feel better.

### Things you can do yourself

You can relieve symptoms of scarlet fever by:

- drinking cool fluids
- eating soft foods to ease a sore throat
- taking painkillers like paracetamol to bring down a temperature (don’t give
  aspirin to children under 16)
- using calamine lotion or antihistamine tablets to stop itching

## How long scarlet fever lasts

Scarlet fever lasts around a week.

You’re infectious from up to 7 days before the symptoms start, until:

-  24 hours after you take the first antibiotic tablet
-  2 weeks after symptoms start - if you don’t take antibiotics

## Is scarlet fever dangerous?

In the past scarlet fever was a serious illness, but antibiotics now mean
it’s less common and easily treated.

Cases of scarlet fever have increased in recent years. Public Health England
records the [number of scarlet fever infections each year](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/group-a-streptococcal-infections-activity-during-the-2016-to-2017-season).

Complications are rare but can include:

- ear infection
- throat abscess
- pneumonia
- meningitis
- rheumatic fever

People with the skin condition impetigo are more prone to complications.

## How to avoid spreading scarlet fever

Scarlet fever is very infectious and easily spread to other people.

To reduce the risk of spreading scarlet fever:

- wash hands often with warm water and soap
- use tissues to trap germs from coughs or sneezes
- bin used tissues as quickly as possible
- avoid sharing cutlery, cups towels, baths, clothes or bedding
