A stye usually only affects one eye but it’s possible to have more than one at a time.

It’s probably not a stye if:

- there is no lump - if your eye or eyelid is swollen, red and watery it’s more likely to be
  [conjunctivitis](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Conjunctivitis-infective/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
  or [blepharitis](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blepharitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
- the lump is hard but not very painful - it’s more likely to be a [chalazion](http://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/condition/chalazion-0)

## How you can treat a stye yourself

To reduce swelling and help the stye heal:

- soak a clean flannel in warm water
- hold it against your eye for 5 to 10 minutes
- repeat this 3 or 4 times a day 

To relieve the pain, take painkillers such as [paracetamol](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Painkillers-paracetamol/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
or [ibuprofen](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/painkillers-ibuprofen/Pages/Introduction.aspx). You can buy these
in supermarkets and pharmacies. Don’t give aspirin to children under 16.

Avoid wearing contact lenses and eye makeup until the stye has burst and healed.

!!! warning
  Don’t try to burst a stye or remove an eyelash yourself. This can spread the infection.
!!!

!!! attention
  ## See a GP if your stye:
  
  - is very painful or swollen
  - doesn’t get better within a few weeks
  - affects your vision
!!!

## Treatment from a GP

Your GP may:

- burst the stye with a thin, sterilised needle
- remove the eyelash closest to the stye  
- refer you to an eye specialist in hospital

## You can’t always prevent a stye

Styes are often caused by bacteria infecting an eyelash follicle or eyelid gland. You’re also more likely to get a stye if you have long-term [blepharitis](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Blepharitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

You can help to prevent styes with some simple hygiene measures.
