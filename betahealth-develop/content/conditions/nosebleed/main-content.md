## Causes of a nosebleed

The inside of the nose is delicate and nosebleeds happen when it’s damaged.
This can be caused by:

- picking your nose
- blowing your nose too hard
- the inside of your nose being too dry (because of a change in air temperature)

Nosebleeds that need medical attention can come from deeper inside the nose and
usually affect adults. They can be caused by:

- an injury or broken nose
- high blood pressure
- conditions that affect how the blood clots or the blood vessels
- certain medicines, like warfarin

Sometimes the cause of a nosebleed is unknown.

Certain people are more prone to getting nosebleeds, including:

- children (they usually grow out of them by 11)
- elderly people
- pregnant women

## How to stop a nosebleed yourself

- sit or stand upright (don’t lie down)
- pinch your nose just above your nostrils for 10 to 15 minutes
- lean forward and breath through your mouth
- place an icepack (or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a teatowel) at the
  top of your nose

## Hospital treatment

If doctors can see where the blood is coming from they may seal it by applying
a stick with a special chemical on it to stop the bleeding.

If this isn’t possible, doctors might pack your nose with special sponges to
stop the bleeding. You may need to stay in hospital for a day or two for this.

## When your nosebleed stops

After a nosebleed has stopped, try not to do the following for 24 hours:

- blow your nose
- pick your nose
- drink hot drinks or alcohol
- do any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise

Also, don’t pick any scabs that form (they help it to heal and prevent infection).
