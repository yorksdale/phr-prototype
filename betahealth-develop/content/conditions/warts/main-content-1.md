Warts don’t cause you any harm but some people find them itchy, painful or embarrassing.
Verrucas are more likely to be painful - like standing on a needle.

You can treat warts if they’re bothering you, they keep coming back or they’re painful.


## Your pharmacist can help with warts and verrucas

You can buy creams, plasters and sprays from pharmacies to get rid of warts and verrucas.

These treatments can take up to 3 months, they may irritate your skin and don’t always work.
You shouldn’t use these treatments on your face.

Your pharmacist can give you advice about the best treatment for you.

## Treatment from your GP

Your GP may be able to freeze a wart or verruca so it falls off a few weeks later. Sometimes it takes a few sessions.

Check with your GP if the NHS pays for this treatment in your area.

If treatment hasn’t worked or you have a wart on your face, your GP might refer you to a skin specialist.
Other treatments include minor surgery and treatment with laser or light.


## How to stop warts and verrucas spreading

Warts and verrucas are caused by a virus. They can be spread to other people by contaminated objects or surfaces,
or through close skin contact.

You’re more likely to spread a wart or verruca if your skin is wet or damaged.
