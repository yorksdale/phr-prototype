### Sexual health clinics can help with bacterial vaginosis

Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urine system.

Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you don’t need an
appointment. They’ll often get test results quicker than GP practices.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) doesn’t usually cause any soreness or itching. If

## What happens at your appointment

Your GP or sexual health clinic will want to confirm it’s BV and rule out a
sexually transmitted infection (STI).

You’ll be asked about your symptoms. If it’s not clear it’s BV:

- a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina
- a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge inside your vagina to test for
  other infections

This won’t hurt, but it may feel uncomfortable.

## Treatment for bacterial vaginosis

BV is usually treated with antibiotic tablets or gel. These are prescribed by
your GP or sexual health clinic.

If you’re pregnant, it’s often safe to use treatment.

Partners don’t need treatment, unless female partners have symptoms.

You can get gels to treat BV at supermarkets and pharmacies but there’s no
clear proof they work.

### Recurring bacterial vaginosis

It’s common for BV to come back, usually within 3 months.

You’ll need to take treatment for longer (for up to 6 months) if you keep
getting BV (you get it more than twice in 6 months).

Your GP or sexual health clinic can help identify if something is triggering
your BV, such as your period or sex. They will recommend how long you need to
treat BV.
