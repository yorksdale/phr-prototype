## What causes bacterial vaginosis

Bacterial vaginosis happens when there’s a change in the natural balance of
bacteria in your vagina. What causes this to happen isn’t fully known, but
you’re more likely to get it if:

- you’re sexually active
- you’ve had a change of partner
- you have an IUD (contraception device)
- you use perfumed products on your vagina

BV is not classed as an STI, even though it can be triggered by sex. A woman
can pass it to another women during sex. However, women who haven’t had sex
can also get BV.

## Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy

If you develop BV in pregnancy, there’s a small risk of complications, such
as premature birth or miscarriage.

However, BV causes no problems in the majority of pregnancies. Speak to your
GP or midwife if you’re pregnant and your vaginal discharge changes.
