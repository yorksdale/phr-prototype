## How to treat sprains and strains yourself

For the first couple of days follow the 4 steps known as RICE therapy to help
bring down swelling and support the injury:

1. **Rest** - try not to put weight on it and stop any exercise or activities
1. **Ice** - apply an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a
   teatowel) to the injury for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
1. **Compression** - wrap a bandage around the injury to support it
1. **Elevate** - as much as possible keep it raised on a pillow

To help prevent swelling, try to avoid heat, such as hot baths and heat packs,
alcohol and getting massages for the first couple of days.

When you can move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep
moving it so the joint or muscle doesn’t become stiff.

## You can’t always prevent sprains and strains

Sprains and strains happen when you overstretch or twist a muscle. Not warming
up before exercising, tired muscles and playing sport are common causes.

## Your pharmacist can help with sprains and strains

Your pharmacist can recommend the best painkiller. This might be tablets or a
cream or gel you rub on the skin.

Painkillers like paracetamol will ease the pain and ibuprofen will bring down
swelling. However, you shouldn’t take ibuprofen for 48 hours after your injury
as it may slow down healing.

## How long will it take for a sprain or strain to heal?

- After two weeks: most sprains and strains will feel better.
- Up to 8 weeks: avoid strenuous exercise such as running, as there’s a risk of
  further damage.

More severe sprains and strains can take several months to get back to normal.

- the injury isn’t feeling any better within a few days
