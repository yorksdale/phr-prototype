### Thrush symptoms in women

- itching and irritation around the vagina
- soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee

If you’re unsure it’s thrush check [vaginal discharge](/conditions/vaginal-discharge).

### Thrush symptoms in men

- irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the
  foreskin
- a white discharge (like cottage cheese)
- an unpleasant smell
- difficulty pulling back the foreskin

***

Thrush can affect other areas of skin, such as the armpits, groin and between
the fingers. This usually causes a red, itchy or painful rash that scales over with
white or yellow discharge. The rash may not be so obvious on darker skin.

Sometimes thrush causes no symptoms at all.
