## What causes thrush

Thrush isn’t classed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) but it can be
triggered by sex and sometimes passed on through sex.

Thrush is caused by a fungus called candida that is normally harmless. Thrush
tends to grow in warm, moist conditions and develops if the balance of
bacteria changes.

This can happen if:

- your skin is irritated or damaged
- you’re taking antibiotics
- you have poorly controlled diabetes
- you have a weakened immune system, for example because of HIV or chemotherapy
- you’ve been through the menopause
- you’re pregnant
