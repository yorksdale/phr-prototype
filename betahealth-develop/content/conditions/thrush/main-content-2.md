### Sexual health clinics can help with thrush

Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urine system.

Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you don’t need an
appointment. They’ll often get test results quicker than GP practices.

!!! warning
It’s important to get thrush in men diagnosed to rule out things like [balanitis](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Balanitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx) or a [sexually transmitted infection (STI)](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Sexually-transmitted-infections/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

### What happens at your appointment

Your GP or sexual health clinic will want to confirm it’s thrush and rule out
other infections.

You’ll be asked about your symptoms. If it’s not clear it’s thrush:

- a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina or penis
- a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge to test for other infections

## Thrush treatment

You’ll often need anti-fungal medicine to get rid of thrush. This can be a tablet
you take, a tablet you insert into your vagina (pessary) or a cream to relieve
the irritation.

Thrush should clear up within a week, after one dose of medicine or using the
cream daily.

You don’t need to treat partners, unless they have symptoms.

### Recurring thrush

You might need to take treatment for longer (for up to 6 months) if you keep
getting thrush (you get it more than twice in 6 months).

Your GP or sexual health clinic can help identify if something is causing your
thrush, such as your period or sex. They’ll recommend how often you should use
treatment.

### Your pharmacist can help with thrush

You can buy anti-fungal medicine from pharmacies if you’ve had thrush diagnosed
in the past and you know the symptoms.

Your pharmacist can recommend the best treatment for you.  Ask if they have a
private area to talk if you’re embarrassed.

You shouldn’t use antifungal medicine more than twice in 6 months without
speaking to your pharmacist or doctor.
