## Check if you have laryngitis

Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days.

The main symptoms are:

- a hoarse (croaky) voice
- sometimes losing your voice
- an irritating cough that doesn’t go away
- always needing to clear your throat
- a sore throat

Children can also:

- have a high temperature of 38C or above
- be off their food or drink
- have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)

Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses such as colds and flu, so you
may also have other symptoms.

If you’re not sure it’s laryngitis [check other sore throat symptoms](/conditions/sore-throat).

## How you can treat laryngitis yourself

Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you don’t need
to see your GP.

There are things you can do to help you get better.
