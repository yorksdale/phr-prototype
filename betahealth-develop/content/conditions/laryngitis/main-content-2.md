## What happens at your appointment

Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and if and how much you smoke and
drink. They will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.

They may:

- look inside your throat using a small mirror
- wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat
- arrange a blood test

If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, your GP might prescribe antibiotics.

Your GP might refer you to an ear, throat and nose specialist if you keep
getting laryngitis.

## What causes laryngitis

Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, for example
cold or flu. Getting a flu vaccination can help you avoid the flu virus.

Other things that can cause laryngitis include:

- allergies to things like dust and fumes
- acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
- coughing over a long time
- clearing your throat all the time
