You need to cool the person down. Follow these 5 steps:

1. move them to a cool place
1. remove any unnecessary clothing
1. get them to lie down and raise their feet slightly
1. get them to drink plenty of water (sports or rehydration drinks are ok)
1. cool their skin - spray or sponge them with cool water and fan them (ice packs around the armpits or neck are good too)

Every few minutes, check that their breathing and pulse are ok.

Stay with them until they are better.

They should start to cool down and feel better within 30 minutes.

## Preventing heat exhaustion and heat stroke

There is a high risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke during hot weather or exercise.

To help prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke:

- drink plenty of cold drinks, especially when exercising
- take cool baths or showers
- wear light-colored, loose clothing
- sprinkle water over skin or clothes
- avoid the sun between 11am and 3pm
- avoid excess alcohol
- avoid extreme exercise

This will also prevent dehydration and help your body keep itself cool.

Keep an eye on children, the elderly and people with long-term health conditions (like diabetes or heart problems)
because theyâ€™re more at risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
