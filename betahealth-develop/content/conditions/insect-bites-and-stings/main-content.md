## First aid for insect bites and stings

To deal with any redness, swelling and any stinging or burning pain:

1. remove the sting if you can see it
2. clean the wound with soap and water
3. apply something cold to the skin - for example a damp cloth or ice pack
4. raise the hand, foot or leg if that’s where bite or sting is

!!! warning
  If the bite or sting is on the face, call 111 for first aid advice because the reaction can be more severe.
!!!

To reduce the risk of infection apply antiseptic to the bite or sting and try not to scratch it or burst any blisters. There’s little proof that using vinegar or bicarbonate of soda will help.

[Tick bites](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Lyme-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx) can be more serious than other insect
bites and the first aid treatment for them is different.

  ### Removing stings

  Brush or scrape the sting out sideways using something with a hard edge, for example a bank card or your fingernails.

  Don’t use tweezers or try to pull it out because this can spread the venom.

  If you can’t remove the sting it will usually come out by itself and is often not harmful.


  ### Removing caterpillar hairs

  Use tweezers or a pen to lift the caterpillar away and sticky tape to remove any hairs.

  Don’t use your hands or brush the caterpillar away as it will release more hairs. It’s the hairs that cause the skin irritation.

  Wash your clothes at the highest possible temperature to remove any hairs.

## Preventing insect bites and stings

To help prevent insect bites and stings:

- use an insect repellent - those containing 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective
- cover exposed skin - especially at sunrise and sunset when insects are more active
- cover food and drink because the colours and smells attract insects
- don’t disturb insect nests - check if your council can remove the nest for you or search online for pest control services
